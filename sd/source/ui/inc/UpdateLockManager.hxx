    A ViewShellBase object is locked while views are switched in order to

    Locking a ViewShellBase locks the frame::XLayoutManager and prevents
    Activate() and Deactivate() calls at ViewShell objects being processed.

    The main responsibility of this class is find the right moment to unlock
    the managed ViewShellBase object: Only Lock() has to be called from the
    outside (usually from PaneManager).  Unlock() is called by this class
    itself.  When all else fails it has a timer that calls Unlock()
    eventually.
