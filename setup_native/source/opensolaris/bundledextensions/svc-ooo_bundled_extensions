#The start method is used for installing and updating the
#extensions. The service keeps a list
#(share/extensions/install/installed) of the extensions which were
#already installed. During installation, the bundled extensions are
#copied to the install folder (share/extensions/install). Finally this
#service, which is part of the office installation package, will be
#started and the start "method" of this script is called. Then all
#extensions in the "install" folder are checked if they are already
#installed by reading the list "installed". Because the list is empty
#at this time, all the extensions will be installed.
#
#If this service is restarted then the script checks if there is an
#extensions which is not yet installed, that is there is no entry for
#it in the 'installed' file. Only if this is the case then that
#extensions will be installed and its path is added to 'installed'.
#
#In case of an update, new versions of existing extensions and
#completely new extensions may be copied to the 'install' folder. Also
#a new 'installed' file will be copied which replaces the existing
#file. The new 'installed' file does not contain any entries of
#installed extensions. Therefore the next time when the start method is
#run all extensions contained in share/extensions/install will be
#installed.
