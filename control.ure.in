Description: LibreOffice UNO runtime environment -- public shared libraries
 The Uno Runtime Environment (URE) is the well-known UNO component model
 of LibreOffice, packaged up as an individual product.
 .
 It offers you a flexible, low-overhead component model that is most ideal 
 for (but not limited to) combining in one application components written in
 different computer languages, and developed by different parties. You can use
 it to create any kind of application, in whatever application domain you can
 imagine.
 .
 This package contains the public libraries:
  - libuno_sal: System Abstraction Layer (C Interface)
  - libuno_salhelpergcc3: additional C++ functionality for sal
  - libuno_cppu: C++ UNO bridge (C Interface)
  - libuno_cppuhelpergcc3: additionl C++ functionality for cppu
  - libuno_purpenvhelpergcc3: "purpose environments" helper
