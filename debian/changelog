      Description), it is not in the default install anymore
    - generalize -style-* Breaks: in common to always break -style-*
      (<< ${basis-version}) and add a Breaks on (>= 1:{next-basis-version})
      so that we don't "loose" icons because of not-matching basis. Thanks

      with the current packaging due to shlibdeps.

      around #412970.

  * debian/scripts/vars.*: add mips and kfreebsd-i386/-amd64
  * debian/control*.in:

    - disable sk, mk, bg help (< 45%)
    - enable hi-IN help (51%), make -help-in Depend on ttf-devanagari-fonts
      since without Lohit Hindi we get broken headers/bold text
  * debian/control.help.in:
    - make -help-XY depend on -l10n-XY since -help-XY seems to have no
      effect when -l10n-* isn't there and the UI is switched to
      that language. By the way this closes: #258841

    - WITH_AGG=n; not used in OOo yet (although built-in), just in the source
      because of "internal [Sun] reasons..."
    - stop adding ($(BUILDER)) to OOO_VENDOR. It ends up only in the res files

    - once again, change the Mozilla suggestions (this time also in the
      package descriptions): remove all transitional packages except
      thunderbird (still "normal" in testing), add icedove in front of
      "thunderbird". Keep mozilla-browser since it's still present in unstable.
    - Analogous with the xlibmesa-gl | libgl1 suggestion, just keep libgl1

    - enable packaging of -qa-* (requested by OOo QA) and fix README.qa
      installation

    - remove build-dep on tcsh

      -common, we have the right version from ooo-build installed into
      ttf-opensymbol
    - create symlink /usr/lib/openoffice/program/libhsqldb2 ->
      /usr/lib/openoffice/program/libhsqldb2.so, hopefully closes: #340468
    - remove README_* from /usr/lib/openoffice/share/readmes and
      /usr/lib/openoffice/readmes; install README and README.html into
      /usr/share/doc/openoffice.org-common
    - enable hu, da, en-GB, nl, lt help
    - move scsolver.uno.so into -calc
    - readd lost USE_SYSTEM_HUNSPELL variable; set it to y for sid to actually
      build with system-hunspell
    - remove USE_SABLOT/USE_LIBXSLT conditionals.
    - create wrapper scripts setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH for the SDK binaries
      again, thanks Miguel Telleira de Esteban for the report.

      - enable CalcSolver patchset
      - stop applying xmlhelp-use-system-libxslt.diff; works on i386 but ppc
        crashes; and just not specifying --with-system-lixbslt doesn't work
        either.
  * debian/control.in, debian/control.gcj.in, debian/rules: disable -gcj
    build, the wizards don't work with it installed. move -gcj into
    control.gcj.in, conflict against openoffice.org-gcj to
    openoffice.org-java-common to force it off the system for those who
    already installed it.
  * debian/openoffice.org-gcj-{pre,post}{inst,rm}.in: use gij instead of

      stuff not in -dev-doc in the html files referencing it.
    - patch-55 (parts; without dicdir-symlinking yet) and patch-57:
      + Symlink some identical draw and impress files in the help packages.
        (4% smaller).
      + Symlink identical template files in the l10n packages (20% to 70%
        smaller)

      disable it per default, though due to its size (324 MB deb, 1 GB i-s)

      with g++-4.0 and remove g++-3.4 builddep on sparc (closes: #343011)
    - remove jurt patch introduced in 2.0.0-5 again. Not clear whether that
      really makes sense, and a similar patch for lib at the beginning makes
      the build fail. Not to mention System.mapLibraryName() does somehow
      now also give me libfoo.so also where #340468 was reproducible. To be
      investigated.

      disable -hunspell because we'd need a epoch when we upload a rc to

    - enable cairo canvas build, disabled per default though
    - add extra sysui build step back because of changed upstream behaviour
    - enable rw, it doesn't work with "locales" but with
      "belocs-locales-data", so add a new LOCALES_DEPENDS variable letting
      it depending on belocs-locales-data and "the rest" on
      "locales | belocs-locales-data". Same for the other languages not
      supported by plain locales.
    - disable bs and lt, somehow doesn't work anymore, to be investigated
    - add preliminary support for builds without Java; useful for backports
      or for archs where Java still make problems
    - add the possibility to build a non-PIC version of libmythes here and
      to package libmythes-dev from here (if $(USE_EXTERNAL_MYTHES) != "y").
      Use that, updates of mythes would need a rebuild of OOo anyway so this
      is quite overkill.. Requested by Martin Pitt.
    - remove ooonologo installation, now done via ooo-build patch
    - add manpage symlink for ooffice, thanks Matthias Klose
    - add conditional to optionally build without STLport and use the "normal"
      STL.
    - add system-icu and system-xmlsec conditionals; enable both
    - move psprint.conf and sofficerc into /etc/openoffice; add a dummy
      sofficrc just referencing /etc/openoffice/sofficerc in ../program to
      make OOo work...
    - Remove the "<app> makes it possible" from the German desktop
      translations.
    - install (and create) GNOME .keys, .mime and .applications
    - install DicOOo
    - install dictionary.lst symlink (closes: #320831)
    - disable --with-system-sablot; breaks displaying of help, thanks Matthias
      Klose
    - export JAVA_HOME in debian/rules; otherwise the registration of
      the Java compponent somehow fail
    - several updates for 1.9.x -> 2.0; get desktop-integration version
      from productversion.mk directlay instead of from the changelog
    - use ooo-build-2-0 branch
    - if we build without Java, run the Javadoc buildstep manually and
      copy the files in install-indep; otherwise -dev-doc (_all) would
      eventually miss the Javadocs depending on where it was build...
  * debian/copyright: update FSF address, thanks lintian
  * debian/*.overrides.lintian: update; override rpath warnings globally since
    we have different files with different names on the different archs and

  * debian/shell-lib.sh: add conffile handling (remove, move)
  * debian/openoffice.org-common.preinst.in: remove
    /etc/bash_completion.d/openoffice; obsoleted by
    /etc/bash_completion.d/ooo-wrapper.sh and
    /etc/openoffice/autoresponse.conf (obsolete because there's no "setup"
    anymore)
  * debian/ttf-opensymbol.postinst.in: don't run fc-cache if fontconfig
    was not yet configured (closes: #303693)

openoffice.org2 (1.9.125-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Update to m125 (aka 2.0beta2)
    - does not stat any font twice anymore on cold startup (closes: #243659)
  * ooo-build/src:
    - translation updates from ftp.linux.cz again; get bg from
      wget http://icobgr.info/ooo/GSI_bg.sdf.bz2 directly since ftp.linux.cz's
      version is broken
  * debian/rules:
    - enable hunspell component. Fix to specify -Nopenoffice.org2-hunspell
      when we don't enable it. Fix typo preventing libhunspell-dev actually
      be added to %BUILD_DEPS%
    - generate setsdk_unix.{,c}sh
    - add mysql.jar, sapdbc-7.5.00.jar and postgresql.jar (from libmysql-java /
      libsapdbc7.5.01-java / libpg-java) to the CLASSPATH
    - remove stale SUGGESTS from debian/rules control. Exchange it with
      FONT_SUGGESTS; for now adding ttf-{bengali,gujarati,punjabi}-fonts to
      the Suggests of -bn / -pa-in / -gu-IN.
    - add debian/rules to the dependencies of the control target. debian/rules
      changes can make debian/control change, too (conditionals,
      @FONT_SUGGESTS@)
    - since ooo-build now has system-mdbtools implemented, add conditional for
      this; enable mdbtools support and build with system mdbtools
    - update cairo conditional
    - add missing , to some BUILD_DEPS settings
    - bump kdelibs4-dev builddep to >= 3.4.2 since there KDE has transitioned;
      eclipcitely build-dep on libgamin-dev to work around install problems
      with GNOME, thanks Adeodato Simo for the workaround and hint. Enable it.
    - handle gzip compressed GSIs
    - some conditional cleanup for Ubuntu, add BUILD_AMD64 conditional
    - fix typo in opens___.ttf installing
    - uncomment LD_ASSUME_KERNEL call, was uncommented for testing and then
      not re-enabled again....
    - the mono support is now enabled per default in ooo-build; disable it
      (still needs the .dll's from the OOo windows installset)
    - build hicontrast iconset
    - install libkab1.so into -kde
  * debian/control*.in:
    - add openoffice.org2-hunspell
    - -dev Recommends: java-gcj-compat-dev
    - Suggest also libmysql-java | libpg-java | libsapdbc7.5.01-java
      (JDBC Drivers) at -base
    - Suggest g++-4.0 | g++-3.4 at -dev instead of the other way round,
      request of Mattias Klose
    - let -base Depend on java-gcj-compat | j2re1.4 | java2-runtime insteadf
      of just Recommending it since the internal db needs it. Recommend
      java-gcj-compat | j2re1.4 | java2-runtime on -writer for the
      Java-needing features. Substitute gij-4.0 dependency on -jars-native
      with java-gcj-compat, too
    - let -core Conflict against openoffice.orgVER-unbundled (provided by the
      official OOo packages from Sun) to prevent a openoffice.org-writer
      sneaking in which would fullfill our dependencies when these packages
      are openoffice.org-* but wouldn't work at all together with "the rest"
      of our packages. Provide openoffice.orgVER-bundled as the counterpart -
      the packages from Sun conflict against it.
    - add @FONT_SUGGESTS@
    - s/myspell-dictionary-@CODE@/myspell-dictionary-@LCODE@/, oops
    - add Architecture: all to ttf-opensymbol...
    - remove unixodbc builddeps for Debian, unixodbc-dev uninstallable
    - add %AMD64%, substituted by amd64 if we want to build amd64, too
    - Standards-Version: 3.6.2 (no changes needed)
    - mention KDE Addressbook integration at -kde and Suggest kaddressbook
    - temporaryily let -common depend on -l10n-en-us until some package split
      issues are sorted out...
  * debian/*.overrides.lintian: add lintian overrides
     - binary-or-shlib-defines-rpath, we use RPATH to OOo own dir; makes sense
       here
     - menu-icon-missing, bogus warning, the icons are in -common and not
       in -writer, -calc, etc
     - menu-item-contains-unknown-tag, kderemove="y" *is* a valid tag
  * debian/javasettings*xml: remove, useless

    - improve GSI extraction; do not fail if there are no GSIs to merge,
      thanks Martin Kretzschmar
    - don't install th_gen_idx.pl anymore; we have it in libmythes-dev already

      Request by Matthias Klose.
    - ooo-build now has --enable-cairo as default, disable it
    - add conditional for the new mdbtools-using Access import stuff but
      disable it for now
    - readd lang= handling as known from 1.1.x to build only one language
    - system-hsqldb is now conditional in ooo-build; add appropriate
      conditional here, too to use it and set the right (build-)depends
    - copy the icons from -debian-menus, not from the redhat one.
      Don't do a extra sysui build step anymore since that's not needed
      anymore.
    - add pyuno conditionals, the pyuno build is disabled on amd64..
    - add conditional for hunspell support, don't enable it yet

openoffice.org (1.0.1-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * In README.Debian, document Xserver bug with Matrox and X Windows look &
    feel (thanks Philip Armstrong).  Add more information about locales and
    language packs, including the known issues.  Explain why fonts in writer
    are not available if served by a font server.
  * link /usr/bin/ooffice -> openoffice for consistency with other command
    names, other distro packages and for Evolution (thanks Jack Howarth)
  * Redirect bug reports for subpackages to openoffice.org until the BTS knows
    about the packages
  * debian/rules: create 2 new clean targets to recover disk space without
    cleaning the whole build: clean-debdir (850M) and clean-instsetoo (2.5Gb).
    Remove package/DEBIAN directories on rerun of target, so conffiles don't
    appear multiple times.
  * In TODO, explain what is needed for an upload to contrib

      /usr/lib/openoffice/program/applicat.rdb
      /usr/lib/openoffice/program/instdb.ins
    - delete patch 005_gcc3_misc_changes, because it is not needed for PowerPC
      and this patch was only PowerPC related.
  * Update description with text from upstream's FAQ and mention spelling
    dictionaries
  * Conflict openoffice.org[-bin] against <= 1.0.1-2 because of the files that
    moved

openoffice.org (1.0.0-pre1.0.1rc2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Recompiled against fixed libstlport package
  * Change user directory to ~/OpenOffice.org1.0.1.  Note there is 
    *no support* from upstream to upgrade the user directory, and I have seen
     too much corruption from 1.0.0 to be prepared to attempt to support it in
     just these packages, so you must change your user settings by hand for
     now.  The openoffice wrapper will warn if it sees ~/.openoffice still.
  * Update some sections of README

openoffice.org (1.0.0-pre1.0.1rc1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream: 1.0.1 release candidate
      (from CVS OpenOffice_1_0_1 of 7/3/2002)
  * Jan- Hendrik Palic:
    - Switched to gcc-3.1/g++3.1 to build OpenOffice.org on PPC.  i386 does
      not work with gcc-3.1 yet.
    - much work on the patches:
      + all changes to oo_1.0_src/config_office/configure.in went to
        001_configure.in_gcc-3.x-fixes.diff
         o set compilervars
         o detecting the right include for gcc-3.1/g++-3.1
         o java will be detected right on powerpc, so we can build
           automaticly, without setting the location of javac twice
      + link against -lstlport_gcc_3.1 (soname changed in libstlport)
        this went into 011_link_agains_stlport_gcc_3.1.diff
      + 005_gcc3_misc_changes.diff did the last changes to compile
        OpenOffice.org by gcc-3.1/g++-3.1
      + 010_use_libstdc++_from_debian.diff is changed to use this patch with
        OpenOffice.org-1.0.1
    - debian/rules:
      + copies the mozlibs into source from some place (sorry,no package yet)
        but I will link OpenOffice.org again mozilla 1.0 from debian
        (I have to recompile Mozilla with gcc-3.1/g++3.1)
    - debian/control
      + fixes the builddependencies for using gcc-3.1/g++-3.1 for all arches.
      + added buildconflict to libgcj3-dev
    - killed extra-dependencies on debian/script/vars.powerpc
    - sets USE_GCC3 to y in debian/script/vars.powerpc
    - changed debian/rules to use gcc-3.1
  * Chris Halls
    - Fix errors like openoffice: [: it-CH: binary operator expected
    - Remove patches integrated upstream:
       008_clk_tck_gcc-3.diff, 015_setup_oognomeappmath.diff,
       016_fontcache_copy_weight.diff, 021_lingu_cvsupdates.diff,
       022_psprint_fontmanager.diff
    - New patch: 015_dont_unset_home.diff - removes unset HOME so ccache works
      again
    - Properly detect GNOME2 session manager, thanks to Gary Coady
    - Remove languages from oo-xlate-lang that are not yet available
      (ca and fi)
    - link against -lstlport_gcc_3.x (soname changed in libstlport) - this was
      one of the showstoppers for getting OOo into main.  Correct lib is
      determined from the compiler in use
    - Fix patch.unapply to work with arch dir
    - Make patch.apply pipe *.uu patches through uudecode for binary patches
    - set SAL_DEBUG=strace or gdb for debugging
    - move global dictionary.lst into /etc/openoffice
    - openoffice.org Suggests openoffice.org-spellcheck
    - ooo-l10n-de Suggests German dictionaries

openoffice.org (1.0.0-6) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix names of suggested ooqstart-gnome and update-mime
  * Revert 903_system_freetype.diff - the OpenSymbol font can not be displayed
    unless you use a font server, which means most users will not be able to
    use bullets.  This appears to be some problem with the different
    libfreetype versions.  Spadmin will crash if you try to add the
    OpenSymbol font directly, and I cannot see what is going on in gdb without
    creating a debug build.
  * Move libmozab libraries to -bin package

 -- Chris Halls <chris.halls@gmx.de>  Tue, 25 Jun 2002 17:57:22 +0200

          + Use SAL_FONTPATH_USER for user font path
    - 903_system_freetype.diff
          + Use the system libfreetype instead of the internal library
  * Chris Halls:
    - openoffice.org-bin conflicts with earlier packages (<= -3)

    - Remove LANGLIST=01 from response files
    - Move arch-specific dependencies to openoffice.org-bin
    - Patch 904_libodbc_soname.diff: dlopen libodbc.so.1 instead of
      libodbc.so.  Added unixodbc to Suggests.  Thanks to Steve Langasek for
      the help.
    - Add Suggests: cupsys-bsd.  With this package installed, printer queues
      will appear in the print dialog without having to use spadmin.
