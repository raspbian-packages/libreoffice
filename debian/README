LibreOffice build system
------------------------

Building the packages from source
=================================
Overview:
  apt-get source libreoffice
  apt-get build-dep libreoffice (to install build dependencies)
    [ somehow broken yet, probably because of the various |'s ]
  cd <source directory>
  debuild

Changing the build behaviour with DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS
---------------------------------------------------
These options are supported:

  debug     - build with FULL debug symbols. Default is just to build
	      with SMALL ones since the deb otherwise gets too big
	      ((>400M, ca. 1GB I-S))

  ccache    - enable the use of ccache during the build. This is highly
	      recommended if you plan on building the package more than
              once, or doing any development on the packages. Be aware
              that you need EXTRAPACKAGES="ccache" in /etc/pbuilderrc
              when trying to build libreoffice with ccache in
              $DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS under pbuilder (this has no effect
              on speed, hough because the cache does not persist in
              pbuilder)

  parallel=<n>
            - enable n projects to be built in parallel.
              The log output can get a little confusing, and some projects
	      may fail still. You need to remove config.status if you
	      change this value after interrupting a build.
	      
  lang=<code>
  	    - Build only the specified language

  nocheck
	    - disable run of tests when enabled in rules


The targets that are built during the package build
---------------------------------------------------

- targets run during the package build -

unpack             - Does prerequisites for the build: packing, unpacking etc.

build              - as the name says

install            - Copy files from debian/tmp/pkg into the correct locations
                     for the final package layout in debian/libreoffice*
	             where we need to do that here because it affects arch-dep
		     and arch-indep stuff and therefore cannot be done in
		     install-arch / install-indep.

install-arch       - installs arch-dependent stuff into the arch-dep. packages
install-indep      -  "       "-independent   "     "   "    "-indep. packages

langpackgs         - Installs the language packgs
helppkgs           - Installs the help packages

maintscripts       - Generates  the maintainer scripts

get-orig-source	   - gets original source tarballs and unpacks them
                     GIT_BASEURL can be set to a local mirror
                     GIT_BRANCH is the branch to clone from the repos
                     GIT_TAG is tag that should be packed 
                     GIT_BRANCH and GIT_TAG can both be master

Building the package from git master
====================================
To do a build from git master, do:
  mkdir libreoffice-git
  cd libreoffice-git
  git clone git://anonscm.debian.org/pkg-openoffice/libreoffice.git debian
  ./debian/rules unpack GIT_BRANCH=master GIT_TAG=master SOURCE_TARBALLS=n
  dpkg-buildpackage

Build system file layout
========================
debian/scripts:
  Directory containing various debian-specific build-related scripts.
