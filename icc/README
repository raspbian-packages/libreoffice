This project is used to generate the ICC color
profile needed in module vcl in order to export
to PDF/A-1a.
It's composed of a small application, which lurks in:

icc/source/create_sRGB_profile

That application links to a support library
(icc/download/SampleICC-1.3.2), build at OOo
build time.
Finally, the application is run at OOo build time to
generate the only file delivered to solver:
sRGB-IEC61966-2.1.hxx.

If you need to change the data into the ICC profile,
please change the create_sRGB_profile.

The library was downloaded from:
http://sampleicc.sourceforge.net
on 2007-08-23.

For information on ICC profiles, you may want to visit:
